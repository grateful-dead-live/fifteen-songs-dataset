# fifteen-songs-dataset
A small set of soundboard recordings of different performances of fifteen grateful dead songs

The file `dataset.json` contains a dictionary with an entry for each song consisting of a dictionary of all of its versions along with their suggested tuning ratios. The audio files can be downloaded from the Live Music Archive of the Internet Archive.

The `leadsheets` folder contains a leadsheet for each of the fifteen songs, compiled from our own transcriptions as well as leadsheets published online at [JDarks](http://jdarks.com/GDTab.html) and [Ultimate Guitar](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com).
